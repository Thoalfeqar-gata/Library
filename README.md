# Library
This project has been a lot of fun for me personally. The main thing that I learned from it is how to use constructor functions in JavaScript to create
objects, and how to use the prototype property to attach methods to those objecs such that they all share the same methods without duplication.
I also learned/did the following:
1. I really focused on trying to make this project as mobile responsive as possible, and while it might not look the greatest, I think the end result turned out to be nice.
2. I learned how to create a pop-up form in the middle of the screen, and create a shadow/overlay effect to highlight the form.
3. I also tried my best to make the code as easy to read and understand as possible, so I did some refactoring close to the end of the project.
